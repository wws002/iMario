# iMario

This is an extension of a java based mario game that uses artificial intelligence to beat itself. The model simulates each possible action at the moment and determines which action results in a "higher score". The score is based on how far left the player is able to go and how many coins they pick up along the way.


To run: ./build.bash; java Game
